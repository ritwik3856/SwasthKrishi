The fungus thrives in moist conditions and can spread quickly in humid environments  \nWarm temperatures: Warm temperatures (around 70-75°F) also create ideal conditions for the growth and spread of tomato leaf mold. The fungus can rapidly reproduce in warm weather and can cause significant damage to the tomato plants.  \nOverhead watering: Overhead watering can contribute to the development and spread of tomato leaf mold. When the foliage of the tomato plants gets wet, it creates a moist environment that is favorable for the growth of the fungus.  \nPoor air circulation: Poor air circulation can also contribute to the development of tomato leaf mold. When there is not enough air movement around the plants, moisture can accumulate on the foliage and provide a perfect breeding ground for the fungus.",

Water the plants at the base, and avoid getting the leaves wet while watering. Also, avoid overhead watering, especially during humid conditions.  \nProvide good air circulation: Good air circulation helps to reduce humidity around the plants, making it less conducive for fungal growth.
